<div class="textblock"><h2>What is GTS</h2>
<p>Galah Testing Suite (GTS) is an automated marking, feedback and grading suite. It is designed to best work within Galah, a web based automated testing and feedback framework but is not tied exclusively to the Galah system. Work on Galah can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/brownhead/galah">https://github.com/brownhead/galah</a></p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>The Galah Testing Suite (GTS) has a mutli-step past that started out as simply a way to eliminate hand grading of programming assignments.</p>
<h3>Initial Premise</h3>
<p>The initial design of the testing suite was developed entirely as an automated testing and marking generation framework for CS 10 (Introduction to Computer Science) at University of California, Riverside. These sripts were written in an amalgamation of bash and C++ and as they were developed immediately prior to their use, they became quickly bloated due to the lack of design priciples beyond: it must work and must be done before the assignment is due.</p>
<h3>Widening the net</h3>
<p>The initial implementation was sound enough to be utilized for a few quarters. However, expanding on the implemenation for additional assignments was impractical. Additionally, utilizing the suite in courses beyond the very first programming course was impossible.</p>
<p>With these faults in mind. A more clear design strategy was created to generalize many pieces utilized in the initial implementation into modules. These modules optionally combined with more specific assignment oriented tests would create a test harness to be utilized for a single assignment. Additionally, a uniform CSV output format was chosen so that outpt is easily parsed for other purposes.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The Galah Testing Suite has several project goals. A few deserving more length descriptions are listed below.</p>
<h3>Assignment Independece</h3>
<p>A primary goal of the project is that each assignment test harness must be independent of all other test harnesses. This means that there will certainly be reproduced code when looking through multiple harnesses at once but allows the replacement or swapping of assignments without any concern for breaking assignments that are not being moved or modified.</p>
<h3>Easy Generation of Simple Harness</h3>
<p>A simple test harness should easily be generated or created based on generic modules. Some scripting knowledge will be required but the goal is to have a basic test harness be a short non-confounding task. </p>
