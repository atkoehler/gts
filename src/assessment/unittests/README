Specific unit tests should go in this folder One file per function, one main
function and one includes.txt

For example if you had one function to be tested named monthConvert there would
exist a monthConvert.cpp that contains the unit testing logic and function, a
main.cpp that contains the core main function that is utilized to run the unit
test and an includes.txt that contains all the #include statements requried for
the unit test.

Every unit test is nearly identical. You must define or change a few things:
   1) the type for the return value stored in ret_val
   2) change the answers vector/array so it has the values it should
   3) define a vector for each of that parameters
   4) define what goes in the input vector if warranted
   5) update the invocations to the generic STUDENT_FUNC_NAME 
        so that proper amount and types of parameters are utilized
   6) update the includes.txt file to contain any additional libraries needed
